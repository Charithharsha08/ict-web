          <h2>What is software?</h2>
          <p>
            Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate
            computers and execute specific tasks. It is the opposite of
            hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer.
            Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts,
            and programs that run on a device. It can be thought of as the
            variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part.
          </p>

          <p>
            The two main categories of software are application software and
            system software. An application is software that fulfills a specific
            need or performs tasks. System software is designed to run a
            computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run
            on top of.
          </p>

          <p>Other types of software include the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Programming software, which provides the programming tools
              software developers need.
            </li>
            <li>
              Middleware, which sits between system software and applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Driver software, which operates computer devices and peripherals.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Early software was written for specific computers and sold with the
            hardware it ran on. In the 1980s, software began to be sold on
            floppy disks and, later, CDs and DVDs. Today, most software is
            purchased and directly downloaded over the internet. Software can be
            found on vendor and application service provider websites.

          <h2>Examples and types of software</h2>
          <p>
            Among the various categories of software, the most common types
            include the following:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Application software:</strong> The most frequently used
              software is application software, which is a computer software
              package that performs a specific function for a user or, in some
              cases, for another application. An application can be
              self-contained, or it can be a group of programs that run the
              application for the user. Examples of

                target="_blank"
                >modern applications</a
              >
              include office suites, graphics software, databases, database
              management programs, web browsers, word processors, software
              development tools, image editors, and communication platforms.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>System software:</strong> These software programs are
              designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware.
              System software coordinates the activities and functions of the
              hardware and software. In addition, it controls the operations of
              the computer hardware and provides an environment or platform for
              all the other types of software to work in. An operating system
              (OS) is the best example of system software; it manages all the
              other computer programs. Other examples of system software include
              <a
                href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/firmware"
                target="_blank"
                >firmware,</a
              >
              computer language translators, and system utilities.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Driver software:</strong> Also known as
              <a
                href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/definition/device-driver"
                target="_blank"
                >device drivers,</a
              >
              this software is often considered a type of system software.
              Device drivers control the devices and peripherals connected to a
              computer, helping them perform their specific tasks. Every device
              that's connected to a computer needs at least one device driver to
              function. Examples include software that comes with any
              nonstandard hardware, including special game controllers, as well
              as the software that enables standard hardware, such as USB
              storage devices, keyboards, headphones, and printers.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Middleware:</strong> The term middleware describes
              software that mediates between application and system software or
              between two different kinds of application software. For example,
              middleware lets Microsoft Windows talk to Excel and Word. It's
              used to send a remote work request from an application in a
              computer that has one kind of OS to an application in a computer
              with a different OS. It also lets newer applications work with
              legacy ones.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Programming software:</strong> Computer programmers use
              programming software to write code. Programming software and
              programming languages, such as Java or Python, let developers
              develop, write, test, and
              <a

                >debug</a
              >
              other software programs. Examples of programming software include
              assemblers, compilers, debuggers, and interpreters.

          <h2>How does software work?</h2>
          <p>
            All software provides the directions and data computers need to work
            and meet users' needs. However, the two different types --
            application software and system software -- work in distinctly
            different ways.
          </p>

          <h2>Application software</h2>
          <p>
            Application software consists of many programs that perform specific
            functions for end users, such as writing reports and navigating
            websites. Applications also perform tasks for other applications.
            Applications on a computer can't run on their own; they require a
            computer's OS along with other supporting system software programs
            to work.
          </p>

          <p>
            These desktop applications are installed on a user's computer and
            use the computer memory to carry out tasks. They take up space on
            the computer's hard drive and don't need an internet connection to
            work. However, desktop applications must adhere to the requirements
            of the hardware devices they run on.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a
              href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/Web-application-Web-app"
              target="_blank"
              >Web applications,</a
            >
            on the other hand, do require internet access to work, but they
            don't rely on the hardware and system software to run. Consequently,
            users can launch web applications from devices that have a web
            browser. Since the components responsible for the application
            functionality are on the server, users can launch the app from
            Windows, Mac, Linux, or any other OS.
          </p>

          <h2>System software</h2>
          <p>
            System software sits between the computer hardware and the
            application software. Users don't interact directly with system
            software as it runs in the background, handling the basic functions
            of the computer. This software coordinates a system's hardware and
            software so users can run high-level application software to perform
            specific actions. System software executes when a computer system
            boots up and continues running as long as the system is on.
