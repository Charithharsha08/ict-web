              >A computer network is a system that connects two or more
              computing devices for transmitting and sharing information.
              Computing devices include everything from a mobile phone to a
              server. These devices are connected using physical wires such as
              fiber optics, but they can also be wireless.</strong

            The first working network, called ARPANET, was created in the late
            1960s and was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. Government
            researchers used to share information at a time when computers were
            large and difficult to move. We have come a long way today from that
            basic kind of network. Today’s world revolves around the internet,
            which is a network of networks that connects billions of devices
            across the world. Organizations of all sizes use networks to connect
            their employees’ devices and shared resources such as printers.
          </p>

          <p>
            An example of a computer network at large is the traffic monitoring
            systems in urban cities. These systems alert officials and emergency
            responders with information about traffic flow and incidents. A
            simpler example is using

              >collaboration software</a
            >
            such as Google Drive to share documents with colleagues who work
            remotely. Every time we connect via a video call, stream movies,
            share files, chat with instant messages, or just access something on
            the internet, a computer network is at work.

            Computer networking is the branch of computer science that deals
            with the ideation, architecture, creation, maintenance, and security
            of computer networks. It is a combination of computer science,
            computer engineering, and telecommunication.

          <h3>1. Network Devices</h3>

          <p>
            Network devices or nodes are computing devices that need to be
            linked in the network. Some network devices include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Computers, mobiles, and other consumer devices:</strong>
              These are end devices that users directly and frequently access.
              For example, an email originates from the mailing application on a
              laptop or mobile phone.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Servers:</strong> These are application or storage servers
              where the main computation and data storage occur. All requests
              for specific tasks or data come to the servers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Routers:</strong> Routing is the process of selecting the
              network path through which the data packets traverse. Routers are
              devices that forward these packets between networks to ultimately
              reach the destination. They add efficiency to large networks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Switches:</strong> Repeaters are to networks what
              transformers are to electricity grids—they are electronic devices
              that receive network signals and clean or strengthen them. Hubs
              are repeaters with multiple ports in them. They pass on the data
              to whichever ports are available. Bridges are smarter hubs that
              only pass the data to the destination port. A switch is a
              multi-port bridge. Multiple data cables can be plugged into
              switches to enable communication with multiple network devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gateways:</strong> Gateways are hardware devices that act
              as ‘gates’ between two distinct networks. They can be firewalls,
              routers, or servers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Links</h3>

          <p>Links are the transmission media which can be of two types:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Wired:</strong> Examples of wired technologies used in
              networks include coaxial cables, phone lines, twisted-pair
              cabling, and optical fibers. Optical fibers carry pulses of light
              to represent data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Wireless:</strong> Network connections can also be
              established through radio or other electromagnetic signals. This
              kind of transmission is called ‘wireless’. The most common
              examples of wireless links include communication satellites,
              cellular networks, and radio and technology spread spectrums.
              Wireless LANs use spectrum technology to establish connections
              within a small area.

          </ul>

          <h3>3. Communication Protocols</h3>

          <p>
            A communication protocol is a set of rules followed by all nodes
            involved in the information transfer. Some common protocols include
            the internet protocol suite (TCP/IP), IEEE 802, Ethernet, wireless
            LAN, and cellular standards. TCP/IP is a conceptual model that
            standardizes communication in a modern network. It suggests four
            functional layers of these communication links:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Network access layer:</strong> This layer defines how the
              data is physically transferred. It includes how hardware sends
              data bits through physical wires or fibers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Internet layer:</strong> This layer is responsible for
              packaging the data into understandable packets and allowing it to
              be sent and received.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transport layer:</strong> This layer enables devices to
              maintain a conversation by ensuring the connection is valid and
              stable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Application layer:</strong> This layer defines how
              high-level applications can access the network to initiate data
              transfer.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Most of the modern internet structure is based on the TCP/IP model,
            though there are still strong influences of the similar but
            seven-layered open systems interconnection (OSI) model.
          </p>

          <p>
            IEEE 802 is a family of IEEE standards that deals with local area
            networks (LAN) and metropolitan area networks (MAN). Wireless LAN is
            the most well-known member of the IEEE 802 family and is more widely
            known as WLAN or Wi-Fi.

          <h3>4. Network Defense</h3>

          <p>
            While nodes, links, and protocols form the foundation of a network,
            a modern network cannot exist without its defenses. Security is
            critical when unprecedented amounts of data are generated, moved,
            and processed across networks. A few examples of network defense
            tools include

              >firewall</a
            >, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems
            (IPS), network access control (NAC), content filters, proxy servers,
            anti-DDoS devices, and load balancers.
