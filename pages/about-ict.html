            are steadily evolving on an almost daily basis.

            By using ICTs, there have already been diverse types of innovations
            taking place in the agriculture sector, which include commodity and
            stock market price information and analysis, meteorological data
            collection, advisory services to farmers for agricultural extension,
            early warning systems for disaster prevention and control, financial
            services, traceability of agricultural products, agricultural
            statistical data gathering, etc." (<a
