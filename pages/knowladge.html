            The evolution of computers has been a fascinating journey. It began
            with massive, room-sized machines and has led to the development of
            powerful, portable devices we use today. Here’s a brief overview:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              First Generation (1940s-1950s): Large, vacuum tube-based machines
              like the ENIAC for scientific and military calculations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Second Generation (1950s-1960s): Transistors replaced vacuum
              tubes, making computers smaller and more reliable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Third Generation (1960s-1970s): Integrated circuits (ICs) led to
              smaller, more powerful computers; UNIX was developed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fourth Generation (1970s-1980s): Microprocessors made personal
              computers possible, and companies like Apple and Microsoft
              emerged.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fifth Generation (1980s-Present): Microprocessor advancements led
              to modern PCs, the internet, and new lifestyle changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sixth Generation (Emerging): Quantum computing and AI are
              redefining computing’s potential.
