                The evolution of computers has been a fascinating journey. It began with massive, room-sized machines and has led to the development of powerful, portable devices we use today.<br> Hereâ€™s a brief overview:
                <ol>
                    <li>First Generation (1940s-1950s): The earliest computers were large, vacuum tube-based machines like the ENIAC. They were primarily used for scientific and military calculations</li> <br>
                    <li>Second Generation (1950s-1960s): Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller and more reliable. Assembly language and punch cards were used for programming.</li> <br>
                    <li>Third Generation (1960s-1970s): Integrated circuits (ICs) led to even smaller and more powerful computers. Operating systems like UNIX were developed.</li> <br>
                    <li>Fourth Generation (1970s-1980s): Microprocessors made personal computers possible. This era saw the birth of companies like Apple and Microsoft.</li> <br>
                    <li>Fifth Generation (1980s-Present): Advances in microprocessor technology, memory, and storage led to the development of modern PCs and the internet, drastically changing how we live and work.</li> <br>
                    <li>Sixth Generation (Emerging): Quantum computing and AI are pushing the boundaries of what computers can do. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize computing once again.</li><br>
